# How to create a new webpage

1. Create a new React component in a new file under the root of /websrc
1. As this will be the component displayed on the page, include the following line at the bottom of the code:
   `ReactDOM.render(<{COMPONENT NAME} />, document.getElementById('app'));`
1. In the webpack.config.js file, you will need to add a new entry point for webpack, and a new HtmlWebpackPlugin object to create a new html file on build
1. To do this, add a new object to the entry array with a name cooresponding to the name of the webpage, and point it to the path of the .jsx file
1. To add a new HtmlWebpackPlugin object, go to the plugins array and add a new object with the following format:

```javascript
new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
  chunks: ['{ENTRY NAME}'],
  template: './src/main/websrc/template.html',
  filename: '{RESULTING FILE NAME}.html'
});
```
